💡🌱  INFINITYFARM is a full-stack web application tailored for farmers, crafted by our team, INFINITY. 💡🌱 

👨‍🌾INFINITYFARM is designed to make farming easier by solving many common challenges farmers face every day. Whether it's keeping track of money, organizing fields, or managing equipment, our platform has user-friendly tools to help farmers handle these tasks efficiently.

💻 For the development, we used Symfony as the backend framework, harnessing its robust capabilities. On the frontend, we employed JavaScript and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience of INFINITYFARM. Plus, in the past, we have worked with MySQL for our database management.
